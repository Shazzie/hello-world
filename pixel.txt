Get the Starter Code
If you'd like to start from scratch without any files, feel free to do so! You learn the most by developing on your own! But, it can be a bit challenging having to start from scratch, so we do provide a starter project to use.

You can download the starter code through either:

The Pixel Art Maker repository on GitHub

This zipped folder

The starter code includes all required HTML input fields, as well as some basic styling. A skeleton of the makeGrid() function is provided as well.

Project Rubric
Review the Pixel Art Maker project rubric carefully, and refer to it often while you build the project. If you want additional feedback, post in the course forums or Slack.

Development Strategy
Before writing any code, try loading up index.html from the starter project to see how things look! Notice that the design.js file is implemented in the <body> tag in the index.html file. Your goal is to build out the design.js file to achieve all the interactive elements on the page!

Now, open up design.js. As you start writing your code, keep these three tasks in mind:

Define your variables by selecting the DOM elements that the user will interact with. This is where your jQuery skills can come into play! For instance, the submit button, the table, and the color picker need to be accessed. The value of the color selected needs to be stored as well, since the clicked cell in the table needs to be set to the selected color.
Add event listeners to the relevant DOM elements, so that user input can be color values and table sizes can be dynamically set by the user.
Set the size of the cross stitch canvas as an N by M grid with the makeGrid() function. Use your knowledge of JavaScript loops to dynamically clear and create the table based on user input. Each cell should have an event listener that sets the background color of the cell to the selected color.
Now test it! When you're done, you should be able to create a canvas of any size, choose a color using the color picker, and click on the canvas's table cells to set their color.

Note: To complete Pixel Art Maker, you must be using the current version of Edge, Firefox, or Chrome.
