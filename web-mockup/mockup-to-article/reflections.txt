You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  * What new skills have you learned?
I have learned how to crete a simple web page.

  * What has been easy?

I found the video tutorials best to understand. The amount of material available online is crazy.

  * What has been difficult?

  Initially just trying to grasp the concepts once you got it - it became enjoyable to do.

  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

  I made some notes for myself on Github so I could retrace my steps.
